You were never just a moment.<br>
You were a turning point.<br><br>

You came into my life at a time when I was still becoming someone I did not yet understand.<br>
And without realizing it, you helped shape parts of me that remain even now.<br><br>

Life moved forward, as it always does.<br>
Paths changed. Circumstances changed.<br>
But respect never faded.<br><br>

Gratitude never faded.<br><br>

You showed strength when things were uncertain.<br>
You showed patience when I did not deserve it.<br>
You showed sincerity without asking anything in return.<br><br>

That is something rare.<br>
That is something real.<br><br>

I hope life gives you peace.<br>
I hope it protects your heart.<br>
I hope it rewards your strength.<br><br>

Thank you for being part of my journey.

Diya
</h2>

<div class="textBlock">

We met in a world where nothing was supposed to be real.<br>
Yet somehow, what existed between us became real.<br><br>

Not because of appearances.<br>
Not because of expectations.<br>
But because of presence.<br><br>

You stayed.<br>
You listened.<br>
You cared.<br><br>

You were there in moments when everything felt uncertain.<br>
You were there when silence said more than words ever could.<br><br>

Distance exists.<br>
Life exists.<br>
Reality exists.<br><br>

But gratitude exists too.<br><br>

Thank you for your presence.<br>
Thank you for your kindness.<br>
Thank you for being part of my life.<br><br>

I wish you peace.<br>
I wish you happiness.<br>
I wish you a future filled with light.

Some people enter life quietly.<br>
Yet their presence leaves a permanent mark.<br><br>

Not loudly.<br>
Not forcefully.<br>
But meaningfully.<br><br>

You became one of those rare presences.<br><br>

Thank you for your support.<br>
Thank you for your strength.<br>
Thank you for being there.<br><br>

No expectations.<br>
No regrets.<br>
Only gratitude.<br><br>

Wherever life takes you,<br>
I hope it gives you peace.<br>
I hope it gives you happiness.<br>
I hope it gives you everything beautiful.

There are people who enter life quietly.<br><br>

They do not demand attention.<br>
They do not demand permanence.<br><br>

Yet they leave something behind.<br>
Something real.<br>
Something lasting.<br><br>

Your presence became one of those rare things.<br><br>

Thank you for your kindness.<br>
Thank you for your strength.<br>
Thank you for being part of my path.<br><br>

Wherever life takes you,<br>
I hope it protects you.<br>
I hope it gives you peace.<br>
I hope it gives you happiness.<br><br>

Happy Valentine's Day.
